The exceptions here are still very close tied to the implemetation 
of the JavaOctave package, it would be better if they were more related 
to what the use of the Octave object needed.

I need more experience with the current exception befor I do the rewrite.

I expect to get down to three kinds of exception:
  * internal errors in the Octave object
  * lost connection to octave process
  * user error, this should be recoverable

The reason that it could be nice to distinguish between the different types 
of error is that the user error could be recoverable in some cases.
